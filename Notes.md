Welcome to the project showcase for "MIsam", a result of the backdrop build V3 event.


Misam is a music looper, a device that is used to record audio and play it back in a loop to make music.

The main goals for the project were to create a functional loop machine that can be used without needing to buy a dedicated piece of hardware. Most important for the success of the project was to completely eliminate audio latency. Also, I wanted a simple and easy to use user interface.

The app itself was written in flutter with the main audio engine being coded natively in C++ for linux to have greater control over timing.
Thanks to the portaudio project and their efforts, the elimination of latency could be achieved just with careful planning of the audio engine inside of Misam.

Because the process of making music with misam normally takes a bit more time, I have streamlined the process for this demo. Nevertheless, all audio you will hear is produced by Misam.


The name Misam itself comes from the official name of a double star about 122 light years away from the sun.
